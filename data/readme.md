| Hou (2012)   | Single-cell and bulk sequencing of myeloproliferative neoplasm from a single patient. Contains 58 single-cell cancer sequences, 1 normal tissue bulk sequence and 1 cancer tissue bulk sequence at ~700 sites. Normal tissue genotypes are all homozygous wildtypes. Cancerous sequences can be homozygous wildtype, homozygous mutant or heterozygous. | mutations.csv <br> <sub> _all sequences_ </sub> <br><br> single_cell.csv <br> <sub> _single-cells only in ternary format_ </sub> |
